I am Anamika and I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). As a passionate enthusiast in the world of technology, I find myself deeply immersed in the ever-evolving realm of computer science.


Apart from that I'm also an ardent reader and love to lose myslef in lands filled with magic and mystery.
